<h2>Introduction<h2>
<p>My website has a travel theme, where it will recommend good travel destinations, including hot spots for travellers, history of many destinations and things to do within them; such as the main attractions. These are all based on my own travelling experiences, and I am sharing them with individuals via my website.<p>

<p>The reason for my choice is because I want to share my special travel memories, and help others experience mine, and to be of great help for travel recommendations. The target audience is anyone and everyone who loves to travel, whether they are regular travellers or occasional, there will be relevant information to suit all. This is my second assignment for my module, and I will be using only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to develop this.</p>

<p>Below I have included designs of content placement, and also detailed designs of specific item placement. There will also be wireframes, and the designs are accessible within my GitHub folder where other design related images will be located. The website consists of six pages: Homepage, three destination pages (Rome, Berlin and Dubai, About Us page and Contact Us page. It has simple to use navigation with a drop-down hover menu.</p>

<h2>Initial Ideas, Designs and Wireframes<h2>
<p>Initially, I had planned to design a single page website (parallax), however I soon changed my mind due to be lacking prior knowledge or experience with this type of website. I wanted to create this due to its modern concept, but I decided to go with a regular website where I had more experience. What I did differently with this website was using content boxes to make the website seem almost like a smartphone home screen layout, rather than a traditional looking website with text on a single background.</p>

<p>As my website will be responsive, I have created a mobile view design as well as a regular desktop view design, there will be no tablet design as this is compatible with the desktop. I had begun designing my website plan with a prototype on Adobe Photoshop where I had my initial designs. I have a mobile design and a web design. These were very basic designs, I then decided to further develop these designs but in a paper sketch. These have annotations and more of a vision. These images are attached below, firstly my design and then my wireframe sketches.</p>
