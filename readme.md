<h1>CTEC3905 Front-End-Web Development - iTravel - P15211562<h1>

<p>This is my second assignement for my Front-End-Web Development CTEC3905 Module where I have chosen to develop a travel blog website by using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript languages. I have been using GitHub to display progression along the project, which is evident from commits created. This is also a backup for my website when changes are made, they can be easily reverted. 

This website will share my opinions on travel destinations and my recommended hot spots for travellers. This will share my personal experience with photography of my own as well as locations I would recommend.<p>
