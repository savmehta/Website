                <br>Rome is a very ancient and wonderful city with amazing sights to see. There are over 280 fountains and 900 churches, one of the fountains being the famous Trevi Fountain where there is over 700,000 thrown into it per year. As well as amazing buildings, the food cannot go without a mention!<br>
                <br>One of the main reasons for people to travel to Rome is because for the food that is exclusively available there and not anywhere else in the country of Italy, or if you do find it the taste isnâ€™t up to scratch. Pizza is a must in Rome as well as traditional pasta dishes such as Penne Arrabbiata. Be sure to book tour groups to see the well-known Colosseum which is a must when you fly over, this historic site is simply amazing.<br>
