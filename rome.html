                <br>Rome was founded years ago in the year 753BC, a very ancient city is simply an air open museum no matter how long you are visiting for, whether it be 2 days, 2 weeks or 2 months. There are the usual tourist routes, or perhaps you are up for a challenge you can go off the tracks. Either way, Rome will keep you surprised and make you hungry for more exploration. The biggest attractions known to man in Rome are the Spanish Steps, St Peter’s Square, the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and the Vatican. Be sure to visit as many as possible!<br>

                <br>Regardless of what you preferred holiday is, Rome caters for all, whether it is visiting cafes outdoors or sightseeing, there is room for all. It is also a very good honeymoon destination, so a very romantic city to say the least and also there is fashion all around. There are however some things to look out for, which include being street wise due to there being a high concentration of pickpocketing and snatchers in certain areas, as well as monetary scams to be aware of such as when changing money currency from untrusted members on a street, be clear to never link money with anybody from the street, tourists are their prime targets!<br>

                    <div class="btext">
                    <br>One of the main reasons for people to travel to Rome is because for the food that is exclusively available there and not anywhere else in the country of Italy, or if you do find it the taste isn’t up to scratch. Pizza is a must in Rome as well as traditional pasta dishes such as Penne Arrabbiata. Be sure to book tour groups to see the well-known Colosseum which is a must when you fly over, this historic site is simply amazing.<br>
